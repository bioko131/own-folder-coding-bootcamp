"If" 

or "else if" do have conditionals, but

"else" Never have conditionals!

If you add a number and a string, you will always get a STRING!

How to get the length of an array
ex. console.log (animals.length)

animals[aniamls.length=1] Como definir esto? y por que?

Second day of JS class #8

Psuecoding is very important.

If you click "cancel" on a prompt, you get a NULL as a result.

document.write is only for the DOM. this is only visible to the user. This also overwrites evertyhing on the page.

console.log is only readable on dev tools.

Equivalent operator name is for "===". Also "==" equals "===".

!== is the oppsito of "==="

parseInt() + Number equals a math equation

i++ === increment i by 1

if (userGuess !== 'r' && userGuess !== 'p' && userGuess !== 's'){
	return;
}

variables can be : “string, arrays, number, boolean, function, and objects”

Keys and properties are the same thing

defining variables, and having 

“””””””This””””””” is the context of the currently running function
